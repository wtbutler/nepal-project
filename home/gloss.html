        Kimerer LaMothe: “[A]ny definition of religion must be recognized as inherently dynamic
        ... a dynamic definition moves across the distinction of insider versus outsider:
        something may appear as ‘religion’ to either. Religion ... exists in the moment of its
        performances as a kind of doing that embodies a person in relation to a sense of the world
        – a sense that may be represented in relation to a tradition or as a belief in an Other.
        The relevant question for studying religion becomes: how and why and to what end does some
        phenomenon have meaning for someone as the terms or conditions of his embodiment”
