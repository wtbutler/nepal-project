            Exploring Tibet
        </h1>
        The landscape of a country or region is massively influential in determining how people
        move throughout that region. The same is true for stories and religious myths. In Tibet,
        the geography ranges from mildly inconvenient to nearly insurmountable. This changes how
        stories are spread by encouraging insularity in communities, especially in the mountainous
        regions. <b>This website provides an exploration of how stories have changed or stayed the
        same in various regions of Tibet.</b> With a visual aid, it becomes easier to see the effects
        of difficult terrain on the stories told there.
