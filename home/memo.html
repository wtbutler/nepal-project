        This website is the current prototype for my project. This draft is not complete.

        In subsequent versions, I plan to add more stories in order to indicate how
        the landscape shaped the stories told in Tibet.

        <br>
        Currently, my argument is weak because it has been difficult finding actual myths unique
        to the Tibetan area.
