            Memo
        </h1>
        This website is the current prototype for my project. This draft is not complete.

        In subsequent versions, I plan to add more stories in order to indicate how
        the landscape shaped the stories told in Tibet. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, my argument is weak because it has been difficult finding actual myths unique
        to the Tibetan area, and the history of the region is overshadowed by recent conflict
        with China and tourism.

        I plan to add more proper symbols to the actual map, as well as update the symbols on the
        sidebar and shrink it so that they make more sense.
        <br>
        <br>
        A large amount of time had to go into building the website structure, which I'm extremely
        happy with. The specific aesthetics are subject to change, but the structure of the website
        itself is able to be modified with more stories easily.
